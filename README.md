# ðŸ§¡ðŸ“§ svemail

Create and render email templates using the power of Svelte.

This library is effectively a wrapper around [MJML](https://mjml.io/) but with type-safety and svelte as a renderer in order to leverage props, js-in-html, shared components, etc.

When paired with SvelteKit, you very quickly have your very own email-on-demand service that you can deploy anywhere

## ðŸš§ Work in progress

This library is very much a work-in-progress and may be subject to API changes.

## Getting started

### Installing

```bash
npm install -D svemail
```

or alternatively use pnpm or yarn.

### Example

Svemail can be used as simple as:

> my_component.svelte

```svelte
<script>
	// We import from svemail/components in order to leverage more effective code splitting
	import Svemail from "svemail/components";

	export let name = "World";
</script>

<Svemail.Section>
	<Svemail.Column>
		<!-- These props are type checked ðŸ˜± -->
		<Svemail.Text font-style="bold" font-size="20px" color="#626262">
			Hello, {name}!
		</Svemail.Text>
	</Svemail.Column>
</Svemail.Section>
```

> index.js

```js
import { render } from "svemail";
import MyComponent from "./my_component.svelte";

const html = render(MyComponent, {
	// These props are also type checked ðŸ˜Ž
	name: "World",
});

console.log(html);
```

You can pair this with SvelteKit in order to add api routes that dynamically render templates based on query strings or body params.
